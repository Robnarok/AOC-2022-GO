# AOC-2022-GO
Advent of Code Repository with my Solutions written in Go

- Every Solution needs the input File in the Directory of the day
- it can be run with `go run main.go` in the Days Directory
- i try to use as many functions as possble to be flexible enough for the Second Challange of every Day
- Many of the Tests arent really that helpfull. But i try to test as much as possible
- i have acually no idea what i am doing
